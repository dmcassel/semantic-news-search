               <span style="width:304px;">The two suicide bombers targeted the
Habib ibn Mathaher Shia mosque in eastern Baghdad</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">At least 31 people
have been killed in a double suicide bomb attack at a Shia mosque
in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.</p>
            <p>Two bombers blew themselves up inside the mosque in the eastern
al-Qahira district.</p>
            <p>Close to 60 people were also wounded in the attack, officials
say.</p>
            <p>The attack comes a day after bombings near Baghdad killed at
least 10. There has been a surge in sectarian attacks in recent
months on targets like mosques, restaurants and local markets.</p>
            <p>The two suicide bombers shot dead the guards standing outside
the Habib ibn Mathaher mosque shortly after midday prayers, and
then blew themselves up inside the mosque, eyewitnesses said.</p>
            <p>The violence has rekindled fears the country is being dragged
towards a wider conflict between the Shia majority and the Sunni
minority.</p>
            <p>"The suicide bomber detonated himself among the worshippers, who
were gathering after the call to prayer," policeman Furat Faleh,
who was near the site of the blast, was quoted as saying by Reuters
news agency.</p>
            <p>Tuesday's attack comes a day after bombings near Baghdad killed
at least 10 people in the cities of Taji and Fallujah, and included
a blast in a roadside restaurant.</p>

            <p>And two days ago, a string of bombings struck cities in
southern, central and northern Iraq, but fewer people were killed
in those attacks than in Tuesday's attack on the mosque, says the
BBC's Rami Ruhayem in Baghdad.</p>
            <p>Last month was the bloodiest in Iraq since June 2008, with 1,045
civilians and security officials killed.</p>
            <p>Tensions between the Shia Muslim majority, which leads the
government, and minority Sunnis has been growing since last
year.</p>
            <p>Sunnis have accused the government of Prime Minister Nouri
al-Maliki of discriminating against them - a claim the government
denies.</p>
