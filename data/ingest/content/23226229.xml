            <p class="introduction">The road to the
summit of Col de Pailheres and its place in the Tour de France
plays a vital role in the economy of the small French district of
Donezan.</p>
            <p>Since its first inclusion in the race in 2003, the challenge of
cycling one of the Pyrenees' highest mountain passes has seen the
race return four times, and helped to attract a growing number of
tourists to an area that typifies the romanticised idea of rural
France.</p>
            <p>"The publicity from the Tour de France is something we couldn't
usually afford to pay for on television," says Georges Vigneau,
director of the Donezan Tourist Office.</p>
            <p>"With so many networks covering it and the seven helicopters, a
lot of people get to see our region."</p>
            <p>Mr Vigneau added that because the Tour has so far only passed
through Donezan rather than starting or finishing a stage there,
the costs are minimal.</p>
            <p>"The only costs for us are organisational ones - parking and the
bins three days in advance and two days after.</p>
            <p>"It's only the start and finish towns that pay, when you are
only on the route of the Tour you don't pay. We're a region of 535
people, it's big village really, and we couldn't pay 500,000 euros
($644,000; Ã‚Â£431,000).</p>
            <p>The only other outlay for Donezan appeared to be the price of
banners, and painting the regional symbol - a multi-coloured maple
leaf - prominently on the road.</p>
            <p>In return, cycling brings vital income to a remote area that has
traditionally been reliant upon a farming sector, which locals say
is in decline.</p>
            <p>The Tour's route through Donezan goes through the village of
Mijanes, whose main road is less than 500 meters long.</p>
            <p>On the morning of this year's passage, I followed fans who had
come to watch as they made their way along the roads between
Mijanes, neighbouring village Querigut, and further up the
mountain.</p>
            <p>With the road closed to motor traffic from mid-morning,
human-powered transport was the only way to reach the hairpins
where the first serious mountain battles of this year's Tour stage
took place.</p>
            <p>Up until the arrival of the publicity caravan, an hour ahead of
the race, a steady stream of riders and pedestrians of all ages
made their way through Mijanes, their passage interrupted by the
opportunity to refill their water bottles at the village fountain,
and a solitary policeman's insistence that they dismount and walk -
which they did until rounding the next corner.</p>
            <p>Some also stopped in at the Relais de Pailheres hotel for
refreshment. It has been run by the Labourgade family since 1905,
and the current owner Maryse told me that from the moment the climb
opens for the summer, her business benefits from cycling, even in
the years when the Tour is not due to pass through.</p>
            <p>That includes riders making their way across the Pyrenees on
touring holidays and those riding locally.</p>
            <p>On Friday afternoon, as I was talking to her, a tour guide
breathlessly rushed in in search of a meal for a group of clients.
As he dashed outside again to bring his group in, she told me that
the kitchen always has pasta ready for cyclists as they could turn
up at any time of day in search of a meal.</p>
            <p>On race day a temporary snack bar had also sprung up to take
advantage of the passing custom in the village, but the big screen
in the adjacent barn couldn't be persuaded to work, meaning there
was little reason for spectators to stay and spend after the race
had passed.</p>
            <p>Minutes after the vehicle marking the end of the race convoy had
passed, people began to make the journey away in search of
somewhere to watch, or perhaps attempting to beat the crowds coming
from further up.</p>
            <p>Down the road in the village of Rouze, a working big screen had
attracted a small crowd of those spilling down the mountain. They
clustered under an awning of a temporary bar to enjoy the stage
finish, which saw UK rider Chris Froome claim the yellow jersey and
dash the hopes of many of his main rivals.</p>
            <p>Cycling fans arrived on the mountain as much as a week in
advance, some with campervans, some with tents and all determined
to grab the best spot to see Saturday's spectacle.</p>
            <p>Querigut, the main village in Donezan, is not on the race's
route. However, it has small supermarket where visitors to the area
can stock up on other essential provisions. According to the
supermarket's owners, bread, beer and petrol were the main demands
amongst those who had come to watch the Tour.</p>
            <p>Jean Bernard Roque, who runs the Auberge du Donezan hotel and
restaurant in Querigut, says that despite being "a little bit away
from the route", every time the Tour goes through Donezan "the
hotel is full for a day or two".</p>
            <p>He added: "It's a sort of helping hand to the region, because we
need to make ourselves known.</p>
            <p>"The impact is in the long term, not over one year. In the space
of ten years, we've seen, little by little, more people arriving to
ride their bikes from all over - Danish, American, Scots, Dutch,
Australian."</p>
