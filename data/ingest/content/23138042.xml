            <p class="introduction">Nigerian security
forces hunting for 175 prisoners who escaped from a jail in the
south-west of the country have recaptured 54 men, officials have
said.</p>
            <p>The prisoners escaped after more than 20 gunmen used dynamite to
enter the medium security jail near a military base in Akure in
Ondo state.</p>
            <p>Two civilians were killed during the operation in the early
hours of Sunday.</p>
            <p>The prison authorities deny that Islamist militants of the Boko
Haram group were behind the raid.</p>
            <p>The group, which launched an insurgency in northern Nigeria in
2009, has been behind several prison raids in recent years.</p>
            <p>Correspondents say the authorities sometimes imprison those
suspected of having Boko Haram connections in other parts of
Nigeria.</p>
            <p>Last year, Boko Haram said it was behind the raid on a jail in
central Kogi state, which neighbours Ondo, when armed men used
bombs and heavy gunfire to free seven of its members, allowing many
other prisoners to escape at the same time.</p>
            <p>Nigeria's Vanguard newspaper reports that sources in Olokuta
prison said the gunmen wanted to free suspects arrested during a
bank robbery in Akure a year ago.</p>
