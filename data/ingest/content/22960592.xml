January 2009</span>

            <p class="introduction">An open letter
published in the Lancet medical journal calls for hunger-striking
Guantanamo Bay detainees to receive independent medical care.</p>
            <p>More than 150 doctors and medical professionals signed the
letter to US President Barack Obama.</p>
            <p>At least 100 prisoners are protesting against their indefinite
detention by refusing food.</p>
            <p>An earlier letter by 13 detainees said it was impossible to
trust military doctors who had helped force-feed them.</p>
            <p>The detainees are being held at the US military prison on Cuba
which Mr Obama has said he will make a renewed attempt to
close.</p>
            <p>Lawyers representing some of those on hunger strike say their
clients regularly collapse through weakness as the protest takes
its toll.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2961414-2/fulltext">
The letter published in the Lancet on Wednesday</a> said the
detainees had "very good reason" not to trust US medical doctors,
as they are required to follow orders of military commanders.</p>
            <p>"Without trust, safe and acceptable medical care of mentally
competent patients is impossible," the letter said.</p>
            <p>"Since the detainees do not trust their military doctors, they
are unlikely to comply with current medical advice.</p>
            <p>"That makes it imperative for them to have access to independent
medical examination and advice, as they ask, and as required by the
UN and World Medical Association."</p>
            <p>Ahmed Belbacha, a 43-year-old Algerian who has been held at
Guantanamo for the past 11 years, said every day of the hunger
strike was "an ordeal".</p>
            <p>Speaking to the BBC's Newshour through his lawyer, he said
prisoners are shackled as they are force-fed, and strapped into a
feeding chair with their hands tied to their stomachs. The process
is often made worse by the "inexperience or indifference" of
medical staff, and many detainees vomit during or after the
process, he said.</p>
            <p>"I try to do it when they will not notice - because if they did
they would put me in the chair and feed me again.</p>
            <p>"The medical staff is scared because they don't know how to
measure the vitals with all the shackling and cannot complain," he
said.</p>
            <p>"I tell the doctors that force feeding me is a violation of
their medical ethics, but they say that the order comes from the
guards and they have no control."</p>
            <p>The current hunger strike, which began in February, is the
longest in the military prison's history. Lawyers representing
detainees say it was sparked by tougher prison searches.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The US military, which runs the camp, says those searches
uncovered various banned items, including homemade weapons that
have been used to attack prison guards.</p>
            <p>The detainees' lawyers claim that during those searches the
Koran was mishandled - something the US military strongly
denies.</p>
            <p>The signatories to the Lancet letter add that if detainees are
ever to be transferred out of Guantanamo, they must be fit to do
so.</p>
            <p>They said doctors were "prepared to visit [the detainees] under
appropriate conditions, to assist in their recovery and release,
and certify when we are confident it is medically safe for them to
fly".</p>
